trollian
========

This is a chrome extension to fix the speech paterns of the homestuck trolls. I can't stand 13372P34|< any more than you can.

It's being developed as I read through the story, so characters basically are implemented in order of appearance, starting from wherever I go fed up enough to start writing this. I've had quite a bit spoiled for me, though, and I've got the wiki open, so who knows what I am and am not supposed to realize.

One day, maybe, I will post this to the chrome store. Later, that.
